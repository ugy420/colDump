                    <h3>Greetings!</h3>
                    Samtse College of Education was founded by Bhutan's Third Dharma King Late<br>
                    His Majesty Jigme Dorji Wangchuck. Launched as a Teacher Training Institute<br>
                    on 29th May 1968, the institute commenced its educational journey with only<br>
                    41 students and a few teacher educators. Since its establishment the College<br>
                    has given the country's education system over 5000 graduates with primary<br>
                    teaching certificate, bachelors, diploma, postgraduate diploma, and Masters<br>
                    qualifications. The rich and varied learning experiences we offer our students<br>
                    are inspired by our philosophical commitment to the wisdom of right <i>View,</i><br>
                    right <i>Contemplation</i> and right <i>Action</i> which collectively can cause the arising<br>
                    of the right Result.
